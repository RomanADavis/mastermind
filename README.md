# Mastermind

Mastermind is a simple game where you try to crack the computer's random code given hints. This version includes specs, but no AI. Done for the Odin Project.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'mastermind'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install mastermind

## Usage

If you just want to prove it works, just cd to the mastermind directory and:

    $ ruby example_game.rb
    
but my version is really simple. You probably just want to look at the code and specs to get an idea of how to structure your ownn game. That's great! I wish you the best of luck. This game very closely follows the structure and style of that used in codequizzes tutorial onn how to make your own tictactoe game. This means lots of incremental testing with rspec. I hope on the offchance that I add some of the features I'd like to some day, that this will make such improvements easier to make and more maintainable. You can find the tutorial at:
